2nd Place for CVPR 2020 Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) Challenge. Oral Presentation at CVPR VL3 Workshop.

Trained a novel deep neural network to classify satellite, agricultural and medical images by successfully generalizing using only a few images. Adapts and combines a first-order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn how to fine-tune. Data augmentation and ensemble methods are incorporated to improve generalization during transfer learning.
