Technical interview projects with Xaltius. Whereas the task is to build beautiful UI/UX for simple lists of people. Handles shimmer loading, API error handling, and more. It also integrates Continuous Integration.

Note: Basically, I failed the interview because I used delayed Future to demonstrate shimmer animations. I am happy, however, to share any insights from this.
