## 🚨 Forking this repo (please read!)

This is forked from Brittany's repo, who has kindly allowed fellow web enthusiasts to fork her repo as long as credit is given. Again, thanks Brittany for the permission and please kindly credit her if you decide to fork the repo too.

## Edits that I have made

Having had little experience with the latest tools in web development, I decided to try it out for myself so that I can learn some useful frontend web dev skills. This started off with spending 2 afternoons going through <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/" target="_blank">Gatsby tutorial</a>, which quickly got me up to speed with the basics of the language.

Following which, I spent another afternoon looking at Brittany Chiang's code and modifying the parts that needed to be changed. It's a fairly intuitive process, especially as she comments her code well. A difficulty came in changing the logos, which my good friend <a href="https://github.com/hivestrung" target="_blank">Shiv Gunter</a> did warn me about. Thankfully, after learningg about what he did with the Scalable Vector Graphics.

Deploying had a handy guide here that is rather well written so as long as you follow it, it is quite simple to deploy on Github Pages: <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/" target="_blank"> deployment tutorial</a>.

## Some next steps

Implement slide show within the website.
Combine mixed media - video + images for some of the projects being showcased.
